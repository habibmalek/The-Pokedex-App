# The-Pokedex-App
my first repo wow!
here I will start bulding an app mainly searching for Pokemon through https://pokeapi.co/ API and show a random list of it with a front to back end "full stack" project purely in 
frontend - HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript
backend - Nodejs, Expressjs, Heroku, testing with POSTMAN.
